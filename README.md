# twitter-nlp
 
This is a little mini project where I attempted the Kaggle Challange: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started

I am using BERT for the embedding and a classification head for binary classification of Tweets.

Check out `NLP_with_Transformers.ipynb` for the final result
