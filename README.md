# Natural Language Processing with Transformers
 
This is a little mini project where I attempted the Kaggle Challange: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started

I am using BERT for the embedding and a classification head for binary classification of Tweets.

Check out `NLP_with_Transformers.ipynb` for the final result. The notebook is also available on Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tXPp_ahEH4eYVq5XSgnjKJPWcRa_UhKf#scrollTo=7tGzb_Xce6Sb
